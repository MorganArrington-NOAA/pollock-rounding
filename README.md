# pollock-rounding
Exploration of rounding rules for converting continuous FT-NIR age predictions to integer ages. 

Although Partial Least Squares models are fit on integer reference ages for walleye pollock, model predictions are continuous decimal ages. These decimal ages must be converted to integer ages for end use in stock assessment. This project explores several rounding rules to explore which may be optimal.
